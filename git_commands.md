# Git Commands for Historical Data Improvements

## Manual Git Commands

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\juanp\Documents\Python\0_Training\017_Fixacar\010_SKU_Predictor_v2.0"

# Check current status
git status

# Create and switch to Historical_Data_Improvements branch
git checkout -b Historical_Data_Improvements

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "Implement Historical Data Improvements

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS:
================

1. MAESTRO DATA ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Remove Equivalencia_Row_ID fallback logic completely
   - Implement 3-parameter exact matching (Make, Year, Series)
   - Add fuzzy description matching with dynamic confidence (0.7-0.95)
   - Two-pass approach: exact first, then fuzzy if no results
   - No more dependency on Equivalencia_Row_ID preprocessing

2. DATABASE SEARCH OVERHAUL:
   - Change from EqID-based to 4-parameter matching
   - Primary: Make, Year, Series, Normalized Description (exact)
   - Fallback: Make, Year, Series + fuzzy description matching
   - Remove dangerous 2-parameter fallback (Series protection)
   - Prevent wrong SKU suggestions by always requiring Series

3. ENHANCED CONFIDENCE SCORING:
   - Dynamic scoring based on actual similarity scores
   - Maestro fuzzy: confidence = 0.7 + 0.25 * similarity
   - Database fuzzy: base_confidence + frequency_boost
   - More granular and accurate confidence ranges

4. SERIES PROTECTION LOGIC:
   - Always require Series parameter in all searches
   - Prevent wrong SKU matches (e.g., Toyota Camry LE vs XLE)
   - No fallbacks without Series to maintain accuracy

5. CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Clean, maintainable code structure
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Removed legacy Equivalencia_Row_ID dependencies

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
=================
- Modified: src/main_app.py (search logic overhaul)
- Added: test_improvements.py (implementation verification)
- Added: test_real_data.py (comprehensive testing)
- Added: comparison_summary.md (before/after documentation)
- Enhanced: Fuzzy matching integration
- Improved: Confidence calculation algorithms

BENEFITS:
=========
- More accurate SKU predictions with Series protection
- Better confidence scores reflecting actual match quality
- No dependency on Equivalencia_Row_ID preprocessing
- Consistent 4-parameter inputs across all prediction sources
- Protection against wrong SKUs through Series requirement
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

COMPATIBILITY:
=============
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- Works with optimized neural network model
- Integrates seamlessly with 4-source prediction system
- No breaking changes to user interface

Ready for production testing and deployment."

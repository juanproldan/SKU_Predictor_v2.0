# 🔧 Technical Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed technical information about the improvements implemented in Fixacar SKU Predictor v2.1, including implementation details, configuration options, and maintenance procedures.

## 🎯 Confidence Scoring System

### Implementation Details

#### Database Frequency-Based Confidence
```python
def calculate_frequency_based_confidence(self, frequency: int, prediction_type: str = "DB") -> float:
    """
    Calculate confidence based on absolute frequency of SKU occurrences in database.
    
    Updated confidence ranges based on user requirements:
    - 1 occurrence: 30% - very low confidence (likely errors)
    - 2-4 occurrences: 40-50% - low confidence
    - 5-9 occurrences: 50-60% - medium-low confidence
    - 10-19 occurrences: 60-70% - medium confidence
    - 20+ occurrences: 80% - high confidence (as requested)
    """
```

#### Confidence Scaling Logic
- **Single Occurrences**: 30% confidence (flagged as potential errors)
- **Low Frequency (2-4)**: Linear scaling 40-45%
- **Medium-Low (5-9)**: Linear scaling 50-60%
- **Medium (10-19)**: Linear scaling 60-70%
- **High Frequency (20+)**: Fixed 80% confidence

#### Multi-Source Consensus
- **Maestro + Neural Network**: 100% confidence
- **Any Two Sources**: Higher confidence + 10% boost
- **All Three Sources**: 100% confidence

## 🔄 Series Normalization System

### Architecture

#### Two-Phase Hybrid Approach
1. **Phase 1 (Preprocessing)**: During Consolidado.json processing
2. **Phase 2 (Runtime)**: During prediction with fuzzy fallback

#### Phase 1: Preprocessing Normalization
```python
def normalize_series_preprocessing(maker, series, series_map):
    """
    Normalize series using the series normalization mapping during preprocessing.
    
    Args:
        maker: Vehicle maker (e.g., "Mazda", "Ford")
        series: Original series (e.g., "CX30", "CX 30")
        series_map: Series normalization mapping dictionary
        
    Returns:
        Normalized series (e.g., "CX-30") or original if no mapping found
    """
```

#### Phase 2: Runtime Normalization
```python
def normalize_series(self, maker: str, series: str) -> str:
    """
    Normalize series using the series normalization mapping.
    
    This function implements the hybrid approach:
    1. First check for exact mapping in series_normalization_map_global
    2. If no mapping found, return original series (fallback to fuzzy matching later)
    """
```

### Configuration Format

#### Text_Processing_Rules.xlsx - Series Tab
```
Column A (Canonical) | Column B (Variation 1) | Column C (Variation 2) | ...
CX-30               | CX30                   | CX 30                  | ...
MAZDA/CX-30 (DM)    | MAZDA/CX30            | MAZDA/CX 30            | ...
```

#### Mapping Types
- **Generic Mappings**: `("*", "CX30") -> "CX-30"`
- **Maker-Specific**: `("MAZDA", "CX30") -> "CX-30"`
- **Complex Forms**: `"MAZDA/CX-30 (DM)/BASICO"` parsed to extract canonical series

### Integration Points

#### Data Processing (unified_consolidado_processor.py)
```python
# Apply series normalization during preprocessing (hybrid approach - Phase 1)
if series and series_map:
    normalized_series = normalize_series_preprocessing(make, series, series_map)
    if normalized_series != series:
        logging.getLogger(__name__).info(f"Series preprocessed: {make}/{series} → {normalized_series}")
        series = normalized_series
```

#### Runtime Prediction (main_app.py)
```python
# Apply runtime series normalization (hybrid approach - Phase 2)
original_series = series
if series and series != 'N/A':
    normalized_series = self.normalize_series(maker, series)
    if normalized_series != series:
        print(f"    🔄 Series normalized at runtime: {maker}/{series} → {normalized_series}")
        series = normalized_series
```

## 🧹 Model File Management

### Automatic Cleanup System

#### Training Integration
```python
def cleanup_old_model_checkpoints(model_dir, keep_latest=3):
    """
    Clean up old model checkpoint files, keeping only the latest N versions.
    
    Args:
        model_dir: Directory containing model files
        keep_latest: Number of latest timestamped models to keep (default: 3)
    """
```

#### Cleanup Logic
1. Find all timestamped model files matching pattern
2. Exclude default model file (without timestamp)
3. Sort by modification time (newest first)
4. Keep latest N files, delete the rest
5. Report space savings and file counts

#### Integration in Training Script
```python
# Clean up old model checkpoints to save disk space
cleanup_old_model_checkpoints(SKU_NN_MODEL_DIR, keep_latest=3)
```

### Standalone Cleanup Tool

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be deleted
python scripts/cleanup_model_checkpoints.py --dry-run

# Clean up old checkpoints (keep latest 3)
python scripts/cleanup_model_checkpoints.py

# Custom retention count
python scripts/cleanup_model_checkpoints.py --keep 5

# Custom model directory
python scripts/cleanup_model_checkpoints.py --model-dir /path/to/models
```

#### Features
- Dry-run mode for safe preview
- Configurable retention count
- Detailed space savings reporting
- Error handling for file access issues
- Cross-platform compatibility

## ⚡ Database Connection Optimization

### SQLite Performance Settings

#### Applied Optimizations
```python
# Enable WAL mode for better concurrent access
cursor.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")

# Optimize SQLite settings for read performance
cursor.execute("PRAGMA cache_size=10000")  # 10MB cache
cursor.execute("PRAGMA temp_store=memory")  # Use memory for temp tables
cursor.execute("PRAGMA mmap_size=268435456")  # 256MB memory map
```

#### Performance Impact
- **WAL Mode**: Reduces lock contention, allows concurrent reads
- **Large Cache**: 10MB cache improves query response times
- **Memory Temp Storage**: Faster temporary table operations
- **Memory Mapping**: Reduces I/O overhead for large databases

### Connection Management

#### Error Handling
```python
try:
    db_conn = sqlite3.connect(DEFAULT_DB_PATH)
    cursor = db_conn.cursor()
    
    # Apply optimizations
    cursor.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
    # ... other optimizations
    
    # Database operations
    
except Exception as e:
    # Error handling
finally:
    if db_conn:
        db_conn.close()
```

## 📝 Text Processing Infrastructure

### Unified Loading System

#### Loading Function
```python
def load_text_processing_rules(self, file_path: str):
    """
    Load all text processing rules from the unified Text_Processing_Rules.xlsx file.
    This includes equivalencias, abbreviations, user corrections, and series normalization.
    Uses optimized loading with caching when available.
    """
```

#### Rule Processing
```python
def _process_series_normalization_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> dict:
    """
    Process series normalization data into a mapping dictionary.
    
    Expected format: Each row contains series variations that should be normalized to the first column.
    Example: CX-30 | CX30 | CX 30 | MAZDA/CX-30 (DM)/BASICO
    
    Returns:
        dict: Mapping of (maker, original_series) -> normalized_series
    """
```

### Global Variable Management

#### Series Normalization Map
```python
series_normalization_map_global = {}  # New: maps (maker, series) to normalized_series
```

#### Loading Integration
```python
# Load Series Normalization tab
try:
    series_df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name='Series')
    series_normalization_map_global = self._process_series_normalization_data(series_df)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Warning: Could not load Series tab: {e}. Series normalization will be disabled.")
    series_normalization_map_global = {}
```

## 🔧 Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

#### Model Cleanup
- **Frequency**: After each training session (automatic)
- **Manual**: Run cleanup script monthly
- **Monitoring**: Check disk space usage in models/ directory

#### Database Optimization
- **Automatic**: Applied on each connection
- **Manual**: No maintenance required
- **Monitoring**: Query performance logs

#### Configuration Updates
- **Series Rules**: Update Text_Processing_Rules.xlsx as needed
- **Validation**: Test normalization with sample data
- **Deployment**: Restart application to load new rules

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Series Not Normalizing**: Check Series tab format in Excel file
2. **Model Files Accumulating**: Verify cleanup function is called in training
3. **Database Performance**: Check if WAL mode is enabled
4. **Missing Rules**: Verify Text_Processing_Rules.xlsx exists and is readable

#### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check model file count
ls -la models/sku_nn/sku_nn_model_pytorch_optimized_*.pth | wc -l

# Test series normalization
python -c "from src.main_app import *; app = FixacarApp(None); print(app.normalize_series('MAZDA', 'CX30'))"

# Verify database optimizations
sqlite3 Source_Files/processed_consolidado.db "PRAGMA journal_mode;"
```

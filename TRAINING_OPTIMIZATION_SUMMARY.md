# 🚀 SKU Neural Network Training Optimization Summary

## 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The previous training was completing too quickly due to several critical issues:

### 🚨 **Critical Data Quality Issue**
- **8,662 empty/blank SKUs** in the database were causing the model to converge prematurely
- The most "common" SKU was actually an empty string, making the model learn to predict nothing
- This caused training to complete in minutes instead of hours

### ⚡ **Training Configuration Issues**
- **Early stopping too aggressive**: `patience = 10` epochs
- **Model too small**: `HIDDEN_DIM = 64`, `EMBEDDING_DIM = 64`
- **Batch size too large**: `BATCH_SIZE = 128` (fewer gradient updates)
- **Learning rate too high**: `LEARNING_RATE = 0.001`
- **SKU frequency filter too strict**: `MIN_SKU_FREQUENCY = 3`

## ✅ **OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED**

### 🧹 **Data Quality Fixes**
```sql
-- OLD QUERY (included empty SKUs)
SELECT vin_number, normalized_description, sku 
FROM historical_parts 
WHERE sku IS NOT NULL

-- NEW QUERY (excludes empty SKUs)
SELECT vin_number, normalized_description, sku 
FROM historical_parts 
WHERE sku IS NOT NULL 
  AND TRIM(sku) != '' 
  AND LENGTH(TRIM(sku)) > 0
```

**Impact**: 
- ❌ Removed: 8,662 empty SKUs
- ✅ Retained: 357,161 clean records (97.6%)
- 📊 Unique SKUs: 118,989

### 🔧 **Training Parameter Improvements**

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `MIN_SKU_FREQUENCY` | 3 | 2 | Include more SKUs for better learning |
| `VOCAB_SIZE` | 10,000 | 15,000 | Better text understanding |
| `MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` | 30 | 40 | Capture longer descriptions |
| `EMBEDDING_DIM` | 64 | 128 | Better text representation |
| `HIDDEN_DIM` | 64 | 128 | Restored learning capacity |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 128 | 64 | More gradient updates per epoch |
| `EPOCHS` | 50 | 100 | Thorough training |
| `LEARNING_RATE` | 0.001 | 0.0005 | More stable training |
| `PATIENCE` | 10 | 20 | Less aggressive early stopping |

### 📊 **Learning Rate Scheduler**
- **Factor**: 0.5 → 0.7 (less aggressive reduction)
- **Patience**: 5 → 8 (more epochs before reduction)

### 🔍 **Enhanced Monitoring**
- Added learning rate tracking in epoch logs
- Better early stopping progress indicators
- Improved model saving with timestamps
- Additional data cleaning safeguards

## 📈 **Expected Training Improvements**

### ⏱️ **Training Duration**
- **Before**: 5-15 minutes (premature convergence)
- **Expected Now**: 2-6 hours (proper training)

### 🎯 **Model Quality**
- **Better SKU diversity**: 118,989 unique SKUs vs contaminated data
- **Improved learning**: Larger model with better parameters
- **Stable convergence**: Reduced learning rate and increased patience
- **Quality data**: No empty SKUs to confuse the model

# üöÄ FIXACAR SKU PREDICTOR - DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## Pre-Deployment Testing (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- [ ] All executables built successfully
- [ ] GUI launches without errors
- [ ] Trainers can start without import errors
- [ ] File sizes are reasonable
- [ ] Dependencies properly bundled

## Client Deployment Steps
1. **Copy Complete Package to Client**
   - Copy ALL these folders to client laptop:
     * `dist/` - Executables (977-973 MB each)
     * `Source_Files/` - Text processing rules & training data
     * `data/` - Databases (Maestro.xlsx, fixacar_history.db, etc.)
     * `models/` - Trained ML models (VIN & SKU predictors)
   - Recommended location: `C:\Fixacar\`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Missing any folder will cause app failure!

2. **Test on Client Machine**
   - Run `Fixacar_SKU_Predictor.exe`
   - Verify GUI opens and functions work
   - Test with sample data if available
   - Check that predictions work (not just manual entry)

3. **Setup Automation (Windows Task Scheduler)**
   - Weekly VIN Training: `Fixacar_VIN_Trainer.exe`
   - Monthly SKU Training: `Fixacar_SKU_Trainer.exe`
   - Schedule during off-hours (e.g., 2 AM)

4. **Data Management**
   - Ensure `data/` folder has required files
   - Verify `Source_Files/` contains Excel files
   - Check `models/` folder for trained models

## Troubleshooting
- If "numpy import error": Rebuild with improved script
- If "missing DLL": Install Visual C++ Redistributable
- If slow startup: Normal for first run (dependency loading)
